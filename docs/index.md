-	Purpose / Short Description of CRV_CHECK

GraL is and will be maintained and further developed only in SWAN and SAS 9.4.


Following ***types*** of graphics are included:  

-   Bar charts  
-   Scatterplots  
-   Seriesplots  
-   Boxplots  
-   Heatmaps  
-   Kaplan-Meier curves  
-   Cumulative Incidence plots  
-   Mean-deviation plots  
-   Pie charts 
-   Stepplot  
-   Waterfallplots  
-   Forestplots  
-   Dot plots  
-   Swimmerplot 
-   Sankeyplot

GraL also provides the user with oppotunities for changing the style and creating individual graphs by printing a base template into the log.
Furthermore it takes care about Bayer's analysis environment, so that the user do not need to take care about the &lt;lpic&gt; tag and the .figtit file.
At the moment GraL only support pixel graphics.
